# Running-Mode-Analog-Input
In this project we will modify previous project (Auto-Trigger-Mode-Analog-Input) to put the ADC in continuously running mode.

Then we will print the value in serial monitor when the position of the potentiometer was adjusted from 0 to 1023.

The Potentiometer will be assigned to the analog pin PC3(Analog pin A3) of Arduino UNO. The connection can be referred in the project file folder.

List of component:

Arduino UNO x1

Breadboard x1

Potentiometer x1

Jumper wire x3
